Since the data is stored in rank-3 tensors of shape (samples, height, width, depth), we add a dimension of size 1 at axis 4 to be able to perform 3D convolutions on the data. The new shape is thus (samples, height, width, depth, 1). There are different kinds of preprocessing and augmentation techniques out there, this example shows a few simple ones to get started."
